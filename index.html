    <h1><b>Ice Cream</b></h1>
    <p>
      Ice cream is a delightful frozen treat that everyone likes. In the oldern days, ice cream was sold in a truck that comes down a street playing a song to catch your attention. Nowadays, you can get it in a store or at an ice cream shop. Some places still have ice cream trucks though. According to <a href="https://www.icecream.com/icecreaminfo">https://www.icecream.com/icecreaminfo</a>, 87% of America has ice cream in their freezer at any time.
