    <h2><b>Why It Is Called Ice Cream</b></h2>
    <p>A long time ago, people used ice to cool down sweet cream or custard in order to make ice cream. It was named "iced cream". It then changed into "ice cream" in 1744.</p>
    <h2><b>The History</b></h2>
    <p>The earliest form of ice cream was very different than the one we see today. It was more like an icy drink.
      <a href="http://www.pbs.org/food/the-history-kitchen/explore-the-delicious-history-of-ice-cream/">Explore The Delicious History of Ice Cream</a>says that, "The emperors of the Tang Dynasty (618 â€“ 907 AD) are believed to have been the first to eat 'a frozen milk-like confection.', This version was made with cow, goat or buffalo milk that was heated with flour. Camphor, an aromatic substance harvested from evergreen trees, was added to enhance the texture and flavor. The mixture was then placed into metal tubes and lowered into an ice pool until frozen."</p>

    <h2><b>Kinds Of Ice Cream</b></h2>
    <p>There are many different kinds of ice cream. A few most known ones are mochi, gelato, soft serve, and sherbert.</p>
    <h2><b>Flavors</b></h2>
    <p> The flavors most people know are vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. Flavors of ice cream are not just limited to those three. There are also special kinds of ice cream that you didn't know about. For example, I once tried pig feet ice cream. I was really excited about trying it out because it was a combiniation of two of may favorite things, pig feet and ice cream. It turns out that it wasn't very good. In the website <a href="https://gastronomica.org/2002/05/05/asparagus-ice-cream-anyone/">Asparagus Ice Cream, Anyone?</a> it says that there is artichoke ice cream!

    <h2><b>Ice Cream Truck</b></h2>
    <p>People used to sell ice cream in trucks. In olden days kids would always start chasing the sound of the Ice Cream Truck music. They would even abandon their toys to catch the ice cream truck. What I mean is kids would literally go running away to catch the truck and get ice cream. Even now there are still trucks on the streets. </p>
